The code in the BIOE448_lab3 repository was written to control an Arduino and LCD display for Dr. James Long's Microcontrollers class on Wednesday, January 29, 2025.

This lab was meant to be an introduction to Git and teach us to make a repository and commit changes responsibly. The code can also be easily modified to change the displayed message on the 2-line LCD display.
